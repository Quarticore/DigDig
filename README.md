# Info

DigDig was a game entirely programmed by me, with art and sounds by [89XX](https://twitter.com/DPY40407454).
It was created in less than two days for the [Mini Jame Gam #15](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-15)

# Prepare thyself

The code you will be witnessing in this repository is code that I debated on even sharing with the world, as some of it is so unbelievably bad and messy.
It is actually the first full game I have ever created in Godot, in fact, it's the first full game I have ever created PERIOD. Hopefully that
cuts me some slack.

I have decided to release it all despite the fact it looks like it was written by a 14 year old recovering from an aneurysm, because I think it is a
representation of my first step into game creation, and I hope to look back on this and be able to see the beginnings of a fruitful journey.
